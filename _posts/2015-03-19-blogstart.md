Hey you! I finally did it - my blog is online!

During the next couples of months I will travel to places unknown. I'll use this blog to keep family, friends, and everybody who's interested up to date with my traveling. If you are worried if I'm still alive please check this blog first before you take other actions.

> In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take

That's the spirit. Yolo. I'll keep this blog up to date with lifesigns, pictures, and stories. I hope that there is a lot to experience and to share. Stay tuned.
